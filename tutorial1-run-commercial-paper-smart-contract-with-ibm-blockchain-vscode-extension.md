Using the new [IBM Blockchain Platform VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=IBMBlockchain.ibm-blockchain-platform) and the latest Hyperledger Fabric features, developing blockchain applications and smart contracts couldn't be simpler! The extension is a powerful and intuitive tool that enables developers to develop use cases, and start developing your pilot projects. The extension allows the application developer to easily generate, code, test, debug, package, and deploy smart contracts to a blockchain network; you can also develop your client applications using a single tool. What better way to illustrate than to show the IBM Blockchain Platform VS Code extension in action! 

This tutorial shows you how to deploy a sample Commercial Paper smart contract to a Fabric-based blockchain network, and try out its transactions using the IBM Blockchain Platform VS Code extension. You'll also interact with the contract and perform transactions using Node.js client applications. The Commercial Paper sample you will work with is available from Fabric Samples on [GitHub](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples).

**Note:** This is the first of a three-part [tutorial series](https://developer.ibm.com/series/blockchain-running-enhancing-commercial-paper-smart-contract/). [Part 2](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/queries-commercial-paper-smart-contract-ibm-blockchain-vscode-extension/) builds on this, adding simple and advanced queries to the contract to pull data from the ledger.

## Background

Commercial paper has existed since at least the 19th century. What is it? Well, for a detailed description, check out the [Fabric Developing Applications](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/master/tutorial/commercial_paper.html) pages. In short, it's a way for large institutions to obtain funds to meet short-term debt obligations. For example,  let's say MagnetoCorp issues a commercial paper (or "CP") on April 1 with a face value of $1m. It promises to pay the bearer this amount in 6 months' time (October 1, the maturity date) - the "paper" is a transferable asset, so it can be re-sold in a marketplace. On May 1,  the CP is purchased by an investment bank (DigiBank) for a discounted price -- $0.96 million; MagnetoCorp gets the liquidity it needs. If DigiBank holds this until maturity (managing its investment risk in the meantime), it can redeem it at face value ($1 million) with MagnetoCorp -- a profit of $40,000. This is equivalent to guaranteed interest earned on an investment of $0.96m over 6 months. Most investors in the commercial paper marketplace tend to hold it until maturity, but there are varying marketplaces, options, and strategies ... far beyond the scope of this little explainer.

## Pre-requisites
